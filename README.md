# Homework_Average_Sales_Calculator
Homework

We get the sales values from the user and we add them up to get the total sales. But we don't know how many sales there are. We did similar to this in the class. You can stop the loop by asking the user enter -1 or -9999 (sentinel value) when there are no sales.
  We will count number of sales then we calculate the Avg. Sales then we display it.
